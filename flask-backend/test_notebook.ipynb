      "\n",
      "The submitted contract text does not fully comply with the outlined requirements for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Limitation of Contractor's Liability**: The text specifies that the total liability of the Contractor to the Employer shall not exceed the Contract Price, which aligns with the requirement of an overall limitation of liability not exceeding 100% of the Contract Price. However, the text explicitly excludes certain sub-clauses (4.19 [Electricity, Water, and Gas], 4.20 [Employer's Equipment and Free-Issue Material], 17.1 [Indemnities], and 17.5 [Intellectual and Industrial Property Rights]) from this limitation, potentially allowing for liability beyond the cap in these areas. This segregation could imply that the overall limitation of liability might not apply universally across all damages, claims, and indemnities as required.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exceptions to Limitation of Liability**: The contract text does note exceptions to the limitation of liability in cases of fraud, deliberate default, reckless misconduct, or gross negligence by the defaulting party. This aligns with the exception for willful misconduct or fraud as mentioned in the requirements. However, the text does not explicitly address the exemptions for mandatory/strict product liability or mandatory third-party claims for bodily injury and death, leaving ambiguity about compliance with these specific exception requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Scope of the Limitation**: The requirements asked for the limitation to apply regardless of the legal basis of the claims. While the contract places a cap on the Contractor's liability and mentions indemnities for damages and legal fees, it does not explicitly state that the limit applies \"regardless of the legal basis of the claims.\" The absence of explicit language encompassing all legal bases for claims may leave room for interpretation that could potentially exclude certain legal claims from the limitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Indemnification Clauses**: The provided text primarily details the indemnification obligations and scenarios wherein the Employer and the Contractor hold each other harmless from third-party claims, legal fees, and other expenses. While these indemnification clauses are related to liabilities and limitations thereof, they do not directly address the overarching requirement to limit all contractor's liability to 100% of the Contract Price; instead, they focus on specific indemnification scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while there are elements within the contract that align with the required limitation of liability and exceptions, the exclusions of certain sub-clauses from the liability cap, the lack of explicit coverage for all legal bases of claims, and incomplete listing of exceptions result in non-compliance with the specific requirements outlined.\n"

      "Additionally, there's mention of indemnification obligations related to bodily injury and death (\"in respect of (1) bodily injury, sickness, disease or death\"), which could be interpreted as mandatory third-party claims for bodily injury and death – another one of your specified exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, without seeing all details from 'the Particular Conditions' referenced in this clause regarding limits on contractual penalties/damages/claims/indemnities etc., I cannot definitively say whether these conditions fully adhere to your requirement that no other limitations exist outside those specified. But based on what has been provided here alone - assuming 'the Particular Conditions' do not introduce conflicting terms - it seems compliant.\n",
      "YES\n",
      "\n",
      "The contract text provided appears to comply with the outlined requirements. It includes a limitation of liability clause for the Contractor, stating that \"The total liability of the Contractor to the Employer, under or in connection with the Contract [...] shall not exceed the sum stated in the Particular Conditions or (if a sum is not so stated) the Contract Price stated in the Contract Agreement.\" This aligns with the requirement that there should be an overall limitation of liability not exceeding 100% of the Contract Price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, it specifies exceptions where this limit does not apply: \"This Sub-Clause shall not limit liability in any case of fraud, deliberate default, reckless misconduct or gross negligence by the defaulting Party.\" These exceptions are consistent with those listed as acceptable under exceptional circumstances such as willful misconduct or fraud.\n",

The clause specifies that \"The total liability of the Contractor to the Employer, under or in connection with the Contract [...] shall not exceed the sum stated in the Particular Conditions or (if a sum is not so stated) the Contract Price stated in the Contract Agreement.\" This aligns with the requirement for an overall limitation of liability for the benefit of the Contractor not exceeding 100% of the Contract Price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, it addresses exceptions by stating, \"This Sub-Clause shall not limit liability in any case of fraud, deliberate default, reckless misconduct or gross negligence by the defaulting Party.\" These exceptions are consistent with those listed as acceptable: willful misconduct or fraud. Although there is no explicit mention of mandatory/strict product liability and mandatory third party claims for bodily injury and death within this excerpt, another part does address indemnification related to bodily injury (\"in respect of (1) bodily injury...\"), which suggests compliance with these exceptions as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, without seeing all relevant parts mentioned such as sub-paragraphs (d)(i), (ii), and (iii) of Sub-Clause 18.3 [Insurance Against Injury to Persons and Damage to Property], I cannot definitively confirm full compliance regarding insurance-related limitations.

      "NO\n",
      "\n",
      "The contract text provided does not fully comply with the outlined requirements.

      "\n",
      "While the contract text does establish a limit on the Contractor's liability (\"The total liability of the Contractor to the Employer...shall not exceed...the Contract Price\"), it also includes several exceptions where this limitation does not apply (e.g., \"This Sub-Clause shall not limit liability in any case of fraud, deliberate default, reckless misconduct or gross negligence by the defaulting Party\"). These exceptions are broader than those allowed by your requirements since they include \"deliberate default\" and \"reckless misconduct,\" which go beyond what is specified as acceptable exceptions (mandatory product liability, third-party claims for bodily injury and death, willful misconduct or fraud).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, while there is mention that certain sub-clauses do not limit contractor's liabilities (such as Sub-Clauses 4.19 [Electricity], 4.20 [Employer’s Equipment], etc.), without knowing what these specific sub-clauses state regarding limitations on liabilities or if they impose additional liabilities above 100% of Contract Price on Contractor outside those mentioned in your requirement exceptions; we cannot definitively say whether these would cause non-compliance.\n",

      "Therefore based on available information from submitted contract excerpts compared against outlined requirements - specifically due to broader exception terms included within this contract - compliance cannot be confirmed.\n",
      "NO\n",

      "The contract text provided does not fully comply with the outlined requirements. While it does establish a limitation of liability for the Contractor, stating that \"The total liability of the Contractor to the Employer...shall not exceed the sum stated in the Particular Conditions or (if a sum is not so stated) the Contract Price,\" which aligns with one aspect of your requirement, there are discrepancies and missing elements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The contract specifies exceptions to this limitation such as fraud, deliberate default, reckless misconduct or gross negligence by either party. This partially aligns with your exceptions but doesn't explicitly mention mandatory/strict product liability or mandatory third-party claims for bodily injury and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It's unclear whether all damages, liquidated damages/penalties, claims for compensation and indemnities regardless of legal basis are included under this limit since these terms are not comprehensively addressed within this excerpt.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There is no clear statement that confirms if 100% of the Contract Price is indeed set as an overall cap on liabilities; it only mentions that if a sum isn't stated in particular conditions then it defaults to the Contract Price without confirming what percentage this represents.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The clause also introduces additional limitations related to specific sub-clauses (Sub-Clause 4.19 [Electricity, Water and Gas], Sub-Clause 4.20 [Employer's Equipment and Free-Issue Material], Sub-Clause 17.1 [Indemnities] and Sub-Clause 17.5 [Intellectual and Industrial Property Rights]), which could potentially conflict with having an overarching single limit applying to all claims unless these are considered part of 'exceptional circumstances'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to these points, we cannot confirm full compliance without further information regarding how certain terms like 'damages' are defined within this context or what sums have been specified in Particular Conditions relative to those limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "NO\n",
      "\n",
      "The contract text provided does not comply with all the outlined requirements. The requirement specifies that there should be an overall limitation of liability for the Contractor not exceeding 100% of the Contract Price, which applies to all damages, liquidated damages/penalties, claims for compensation and indemnities regardless of the legal basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the contract text states that \"The total liability of the Contractor to the Employer... shall not exceed...the Contract Price,\" it also lists exceptions where this limitation does not apply: under Sub-Clause 4.19 [Electricity, Water and Gas], Sub-Clause 4.20 [Employer's Equipment and Free-Issue Material], Sub-Clause 17.1 [Indemnities] and Sub-Clause 17.5 [Intellectual and Industrial Property Rights]. These exceptions could potentially allow liabilities beyond what is specified in your requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, while some exceptions are allowed under exceptional circumstances such as fraud or willful misconduct according to your outline (which aligns with \"This Sub-Clause shall not limit liability in any case of fraud, deliberate default, reckless misconduct or gross negligence by the defaulting Party.\"), it is unclear if mandatory/strict product liability or mandatory third party claims for bodily injury and death are covered by these clauses due to lack of explicit mention within this excerpt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on a direct comparison between your requirements and provided contract text excerpts without overthinking or assuming information outside what has been presented here – there appears to be a discrepancy regarding limitations on liabilities related specifically to certain sub-clauses mentioned above which do not align perfectly with your outlined requirement for an overarching limit applicable regardless of legal basis except under specific exceptional circumstances listed in your outline.\n",
      "YES\n",
      "\n",
      "The contract text provided appears to comply with the outlined requirements. The clause specifies that the total liability of the Contractor is limited to an amount not exceeding the Contract Price, except for certain cases which are likely detailed in other parts of the contract (Sub-Clause 4.19, Sub-Clause 4.20, Sub-Clause 17.1 and Sub-Clause 17.5). This aligns with the requirement that there should be an overall limitation of liability for the benefit of the Contractor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, it explicitly states exceptions where this limitation does not apply: \"This Sub-Clause shall not limit liability in any case of fraud, deliberate default, reckless misconduct or gross negligence by the defaulting Party.\" These exceptions are consistent with those mentioned in your requirements—willful misconduct or fraud—and could potentially encompass mandatory/strict product liability and mandatory third party claims for bodily injury and death if they fall under 'deliberate default' or 'reckless misconduct'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, both parties have indemnification obligations towards each other under specific circumstances involving third-party claims and breaches of contract clauses related to personal injury/death attributable to negligence or willful acts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these observations from a direct comparison between your requirements and submitted contract text without overthinking beyond what's presented:\n",
      "\n",
      "- There is a clear cap on liabilities.\n",
      "- Exceptions are noted which may include but aren't limited to those listed as acceptable per your outline.\n",
      "- Indemnification responsibilities are addressed concerning third-party claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on this information alone and assuming no conflicting clauses elsewhere in the document outside these excerpts (which I cannot evaluate), it seems compliant with your specified legal framework regarding limitations on liabilities and exceptions thereto.\n"
